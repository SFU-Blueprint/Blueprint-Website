PEDALS regularly engages with around 3 dozen members of the community as volunteers weekly. ",
      "projectDescription": "To streamline the tracking of volunteer hours and shift management, we are developing a responsive website for PEDALS. Accessible on both mobile and desktop devices, this site replaces the current manual paper log system. It allows volunteers to easily sign in and out of their shifts, enabling managers to maintain accurate records in real-time. This digital solution ensures PEDALS has consistent, up-to-date data available for grant applications and frees up time for PEDALS’ coordinators to focus on revenue-generating activities for the shop",
