      "nonProfitDescription": "Our Community Bikes, which aimed to serve as a DIY repair shop and bike part recycling service to cyclists in Vancouver, was transferred to PEDALS 6 years after it opened. The organization has been offering bike repair workshops to help empower bike users to use their bikes more comfortably. They have also been offering bike mechanic courses and providing employment opportunities to people facing employment barriers. PEDALS regularly engages with around 3 dozen members of the community as volunteers on a weekly basis. They are working towards increasing access to bicycles to underserved communities, and improving sustainability by reducing bike related waste and promoting zero emissions travels.",
      "projectDescription": "To address PEDAL’s desire to have a more streamlined way to sign off on hours at the start and end of the shifts, we created a responsive website which can be used on the iPad in store, and also on a desktop computer, for volunteers to track and manage their shifts and for managers to keep records of their volunteers and create shifts. Some additional key features include a built in a reminder system so that PEDALS can improve volunteer retention, a toggle for all volunteers that indicates their skill level with repairing bikes, and explicit notifications if there was no engagement from a volunteer for a longer period of time.",

      "projectDescription": "To address the issue of accessibility and information dissemination, the SFU Blueprint team opted to develop a website utilizing React, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel. This strategic choice was made to ensure a responsive website that effectively communicates information about our projects to a diverse audience, including experienced individuals, students, and older users within the nonprofit community."
